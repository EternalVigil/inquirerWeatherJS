# inquirerWeatherJS
Class Activity - 12/08/2016

using inquirer and fs, we created a command line interface to select a user role (user / admin)

-if user, take additional input to create a query to weather-js to get the weather from a city location
user search input was timestamped and appended into a log file along with a timestamp

-if admin, print out full list of user searches along with timestamp code for query history
